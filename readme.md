# Markers With Altitude

This project shows how to create custom SVG markers with altitude using the HERE Maps API for JavaScript. It uses the HERE Routing API to generate a route up the Mauna Kea Access Road in Hawaii and then generates color-coded markers. The color of these markers is determined by the altitude of the point and the markers themselves are floating over the map at the same altitude. Be sure to hold down the ALT key to tilt and rotate the map for the full effect.
